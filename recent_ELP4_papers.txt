AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence 
      and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper.
      METHODS: Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by
      cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers
      for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition,
      depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma
      history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its
      allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and
      gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. 
      The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant
      difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no
      significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of
      intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a
      higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele 
      frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical
      symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference 
      in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment.
      After treatment, the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were significantly
      decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The
      frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes.
      CONCLUSION: ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical
      symptoms and the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in patients with intracranial
      arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Purpose: The objectives of this study were to explore genetics pathogenesis of
      isolated agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and assess the utility of chromosomal 
      microarray analysis (CMA) for genetic diagnosis of Isolated ACC. Methods: We
      analyzed the genomes of 16 fetuses with isolated ACC using Afymetrix CytoScan HD 
      arrays and conducted further bioinformatic analysis for one proband fetus with an
      abnormal copy number variation (CNV). Results: Of the 16 fetal samples examined, 
      2 (12.5%) had pathogenic CNVs and 3 (18.75%) had variants of unknown
      significance. Two cases, case 2 and case 9, were found to have pathogenic CNVs.
      Bioinformatic analyses indicated that the CNV of one fetus (case 9) contained 115
      annotated coding genes, 5 of which (SLC6A5, BDNF, ELP4, PAX6, and SLC1A2) have
      been associated with neurodevelopment. Three of these genes (SLC1A2, BDNF, and
      PAX6) may play a key role in ACC development. GO cluster analysis of the
      implicated genes revealed strong representations of protein binding and metal ion
      binding functions. KEGG pathway analysis pointed to four pathways: longevity
      regulating pathway, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cocaine addiction, and
      autophagy-animal. Conclusions: BDNF, SLC1A2, and PAX6 may be involved in the
      development of isolated ACC. CMA is a feasible technology for prenatal diagnosis 
      of isolated ACC.

TI  - Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating SHORTROOT
      Transcription.
PG  - 220-232
LID - 10.1104/pp.18.00534 [doi]
AB  - SHORTROOT (SHR) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots, but how its expression is regulated is 
      unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six
      subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of SHR Depletion of
      Elongator drastically reduced SHR expression and led to defective root stem cell 
      maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of 
      Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the elp1 mutant
      to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction
      of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II,
      support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription
      elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of
      SHR and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on
      the SHR gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4,
      a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the SHR
      locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with
      SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of SHR.

TI  - The Arabidopsis Elongator Subunit ELP3 and ELP4 Confer Resistance to Bacterial
      Speck in Tomato.
PG  - 1066
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2018.01066 [doi]
AB  - Although production of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is threatened by a number of
      major diseases worldwide, it has been difficult to identify effective and durable
      management measures against these diseases. In this study, we attempted to
      improve tomato disease resistance by transgenic overexpression of genes encoding 
      the Arabidopsis thaliana Elongator (AtELP) complex subunits AtELP3 and AtELP4. We
      show that overexpression of AtELP3 and AtELP4 significantly enhanced resistance
      to tomato bacterial speck caused by the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain J4
      (Pst J4) without clear detrimental effects on plant growth and development.
      Interestingly, the transgenic plants exhibited resistance to Pst J4 only when
      inoculated through foliar sprays but not through infiltration into the leaf
      apoplast. Although this result suggested possible involvement of stomatal
      immunity, we found that Pst J4 inoculation did not induce stomatal closure and
      there were no differences in stomatal apertures and conductance between the
      transgenic and control plants. Further RNA sequencing and real-time quantitative 
      PCR analyses revealed a group of defense-related genes to be induced to higher
      levels after infection in the AtELP4 transgenic tomato plants than in the
      control, suggesting that the enhanced disease resistance of the transgenic plants
      may be attributed to elevated induction of defense responses. Additionally, we
      show that the tomato genome contains single-copy genes encoding all six Elongator
      subunits (SlELPs), which share high identities with the AtELP proteins, and that 
      SlELP3 and SlELP4 complemented the Arabidopsis Atelp3 and Atelp4 mutants,
      respectively, indicating that the function of tomato Elongator is probably
      conserved. Taken together, our results not only shed new light on the tomato
      Elongator complex, but also revealed potential candidate genes for engineering
      disease resistance in tomato.

TI  - Elongator promotes the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cell by
      the phosphorylation of AKT.
PG  - 518-530
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.23511 [doi]
AB  - The Elongator is a complex with multiple subunits (Elp1-Elp6) which promotes
      transcript elongation and protein translation. In this study, we investigated the
      effects of Elongator on the migration and invasion of HCC cells as well as the
      underlying mechanisms. We showed that overexpression of Elp3 or Elp4 promoted the
      migration and invasion of HCC cells, which was abolished when either Elp3 or Elp4
      was silenced. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were
      enhanced by phosphorylation of AKT. Elongator-driven migration and invasion and
      the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reduced in HCC cells treated with AKT
      inhibitor LY294002. Depletion of Elp3 also reduced the phosphorylation of AKT
      induced by growth factors. In vivo assay of lung metastasis in mice demonstrated 
      that overexpression of Elp3 increased tumor nodules metastatic to lung.
      Importantly, Elp3 was up-regulated in human HCC tissues, which was correlated
      with the phosphorylation of AKT and expression of MMP-2. Collectively, these
      results suggested that Elongator activated migration and invasion of HCC cells by
      promoting the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the PI3K/AKT signaling
      pathway. Our work suggests that Elongator might be a potential marker which
      promotes the metastasis of HCC.

AB  - Conserved from yeast to humans, Elongator is a protein complex implicated in
      multiple processes including transcription regulation, alpha-tubulin acetylation,
      and tRNA modification, and its defects have been shown to cause human diseases
      such as familial dysautonomia. Elongator consists of two copies of six core
      subunits (Elp1, Elp2, Elp3, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6) that are organized into two
      subcomplexes: Elp1/2/3 and Elp4/5/6 and form a stable assembly of ~ 850 kDa in
      size. Although the catalytic subunit of Elongator is Elp3, which contains a
      radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) domain and a putative histone
      acetyltransferase domain, the Elp4/5/6 subcomplex also possesses ATP-modulated
      tRNA binding activity. How at the molecular level, Elongator performs its
      multiple functions and how the different subunits regulate Elongator's activities
      remains poorly understood. Here, we provide an overview of the proposed functions
      of Elongator and describe how recent structural studies provide new insights into
      the mechanism of action of this multifunctional complex.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation and genotype of subjects with
      aniridia with a particular focus on foveal hypoplasia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three Canadian participants with aniridia and of
      various ethnic backgrounds residing in British Columbia. METHODS: Full ophthalmic
      examinations and posterior segment spectral domain-optical coherence tomography
      (SD-OCT) imaging were performed. Foveal hypoplasia was graded independently by 2 
      staff ophthalmologists. PAX6 sequencing was performed and chromosomal 11p
      anomalies investigated. Candidate gene and single-nucleotide polymorphism
      sequencing in genes functionally related to PAX6 were also studied. RESULTS: Best
      corrected visual acuities in the cohort ranged from 0.0 logMAR to no light
      perception. Total absence of iris tissue was seen in the majority (42 of 66
      eyes). In those in whom SD-OCT was possible, foveal hypoplasia was seen in the
      majority (45 of 56 eyes, 80%). Molecular genetic defects involving PAX6 were
      identified in 30 participants (91%), including 4 novel PAX6 mutations (Gly18Val; 
      Ser65ProfsX14; Met337ArgfsX18; Ser321CysfsX34) and 4 novel chromosome 11p
      deletions inclusive of PAX6 or a known PAX6 regulatory region. CONCLUSIONS: The
      number of PAX6 mutations associated with aniridia continues to increase. Variable
      foveal architecture despite nearly identical anterior segment disease in 4
      participants with an Ex9 ELP4-Ex4 DCDC1 deletion suggested that molecular cues
      causing variation in disease in the posterior segment differ from those at play
      in the anterior segment. Results in 3 patients without identifiable PAX6
      mutations and a review of the literature suggest that such cases be described as 
      phenocopies rather than actual cases of the syndrome of aniridia.

      Fragaria vesca L.
PG  - 230

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant immune response is associated with a large-scale
      transcriptional reprogramming, which is regulated by numerous transcription
      regulators such as the Elongator complex. Elongator is a multitasking protein
      complex involved in diverse cellular processes, including histone modification,
      DNA methylation, and tRNA modification. In recent years, Elongator is emerging as
      a key regulator of plant immune responses. However, characterization of
      Elongator's function in plant immunity has been conducted only in the model plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana. It is thus unclear whether Elongator's role in plant
      immunity is conserved in higher plants. The objective of this study is to
      characterize transgenic woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) overexpressing
      the Arabidopsis Elongator (AtELP) genes, AtELP3 and AtELP4, and to determine
      whether F. vesca carries a functional Elongator complex. METHODS: Transgenic F.
      vesca and Arabidopsis plants were produced via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic
      transformation and characterized by morphology, PCR, real-time quantitative PCR, 
      and disease resistance test. The Student's t test was used to analyze the data.
      RESULTS: Overexpression of AtELP3 and AtELP4 in F. vesca impacts plant growth and
      development and confers enhanced resistance to anthracnose crown rot, powdery
      mildew, and angular leaf spot, which are caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal
      pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen 
      Podosphaera aphanis, and the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas
      fragariae, respectively. Moreover, the F. vesca genome encodes all six Elongator 
      subunits by single-copy genes with the exception of FvELP4, which is encoded by
      two homologous genes, FvELP4-1 and FvELP4-2. We show that FvELP4-1 complemented
      the Arabidopsis Atelp4/elo1-1 mutant, indicating that FvELP4 is biologically
      functional. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on overexpression of Elongator 
      genes in plants. Our results indicate that the function of Elongator in plant
      immunity is most likely conserved in F. vesca and suggest that Elongator genes
      may hold potential for helping mitigate disease severity and reduce the use of
      fungicides in strawberry industry.

PG  - 436-447
LID - 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000405 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Aniridia is a rare and panocular disorder affecting most of
      the ocular structures which may have significant impact on vision. The purpose of
      this review is to describe the clinical features, genetics, and therapeutic
      options for this disease and to provide an update of current knowledge and latest
      research findings. RECENT FINDINGS: Aside from the ocular features, a variety of 
      associated systemic abnormalities, including hormonal, metabolic,
      gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic pathologies have been reported in
      children with aniridia. Although mutations in PAX6 are a major cause of aniridia,
      genetic defects in nearby genes, such as TRIM44 or ELP4, have also been reported 
      to cause aniridia. Recent improvement in genetic testing technique will help more
      rapid and precise diagnosis for aniridia. A promising therapeutic approach called
      nonsense suppression therapy has been introduced and successfully used in an
      animal model. SUMMARY: Aniridia is a challenging disease. The progressive nature 
      of this condition and its potential complications require continuous and
      life-long ophthalmologic care. Genetic diagnosis for aniridia is important for
      establishing definitive molecular characterization as well as identifying
      individuals at high risk for Wilms tumor. Recent advancement in understanding the
      genetic pathogenesis of this disease offers promise for the approaches to
      treatment.

AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Elongator complex consisting of the six Elp1-Elp6
      proteins has been proposed to participate in three distinct cellular processes:
      transcriptional elongation, polarized exocytosis and formation of modified wobble
      uridines in tRNA. In this study, we investigated the function of BcElp4 in
      Botrytis cinerea, which is homologous to S. cerevisiae Elp4. A bcelp4 deletion
      mutant was significantly impaired in vegetative growth, sclerotia formation and
      melanin biosynthesis. This mutant exhibited decreased sensitivity to osmotic and 
      oxidative stresses as well as cell way-damaging agent. Pathogenicity assays
      revealed that BcElp4 is involved in the virulence of B. cinerea. In addition, the
      deletion of bcelp4 led to increased aerial mycelia development. All these defects
      were restored by genetic complementation of the bcelp4 deletion mutant with the
      wild-type bcelp4 gene. The results of this study indicated that BcElp4 is
      involved in regulation of vegetative development, various environmental stress
      response and virulence in B. cinerea.

TI  - The familial dysautonomia disease gene IKBKAP is required in the developing and
      adult mouse central nervous system.
PG  - 605-618

AB  - Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs) are a genetically and
      clinically diverse group of disorders defined by peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
      dysfunction. HSAN type III, known as familial dysautonomia (FD), results from a
      single base mutation in the gene IKBKAP that encodes a scaffolding unit (ELP1)
      for a multi-subunit complex known as Elongator. Since mutations in other
      Elongator subunits (ELP2 to ELP4) are associated with central nervous system
      (CNS) disorders, the goal of this study was to investigate a potential
      requirement for Ikbkap in the CNS of mice. The sensory and autonomic
      pathophysiology of FD is fatal, with the majority of patients dying by age 40.
      While signs and pathology of FD have been noted in the CNS, the clinical and
      research focus has been on the sensory and autonomic dysfunction, and no genetic 
      model studies have investigated the requirement for Ikbkap in the CNS. Here, we
      report, using a novel mouse line in which Ikbkap is deleted solely in the nervous
      system, that not only is Ikbkap widely expressed in the embryonic and adult CNS, 
      but its deletion perturbs both the development of cortical neurons and their
      survival in adulthood. Primary cilia in embryonic cortical apical progenitors and
      motile cilia in adult ependymal cells are reduced in number and disorganized.
      Furthermore, we report that, in the adult CNS, both autonomic and non-autonomic
      neuronal populations require Ikbkap for survival, including spinal motor and
      cortical neurons. In addition, the mice developed kyphoscoliosis, an FD hallmark,
      indicating its neuropathic etiology. Ultimately, these perturbations manifest in 
      a developmental and progressive neurodegenerative condition that includes
      impairments in learning and memory. Collectively, these data reveal an essential 
      function for Ikbkap that extends beyond the peripheral nervous system to CNS
      development and function. With the identification of discrete CNS cell types and 
      structures that depend on Ikbkap, novel strategies to thwart the progressive
      demise of CNS neurons in FD can be developed.

AB  - Aniridia is a rare congenital disease characterized by eye development defects,
      in which the more evident clinical manifestation is iris absence or malformation.
      In most of the patients, aniridia is associated to PAX6 gene point mutations or
      deletions. When these deletions are large and involve other genes, a more complex
      disease, named WAGR syndrome, arises. In order to develop a new tool to analyze
      aniridia and WAGR subjects, a CGH array (CGHa) of the PAX6 genomic region was set
      up. We generated a custom microarray kit using an oligonucleotide-based platform 
      that allows high resolution molecular profiling of genomic aberrations in 20 Mb
      of the 11p13 chromosomal region, centered on the PAX6 gene. The average probe
      spacing was 100 bp. Thirty-five subjects have been analyzed. The major advantage 
      of CGHa compared to MLPA was the knowledge of the deletions borders. Our approach
      identifies patients harboring deletions including the WT1 gene and, therefore, at
      risk for kidney tumors. The CGHa assay confirmed that several aniridia patients
      show a deletion at the level of ELP4 gene, without involvement of the PAX6 exonic
      regions. In all these patients, deletions include the PAX6 transcriptional
      enhancer SIMO. This finding further highlights the role of mutation/deletion of
      long-range enhancers in monogenic human pathology.

TI  - A microRNA-328 binding site in PAX6 is associated with centrotemporal spikes of
      rolandic epilepsy.
PG  - 512-22

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rolandic epilepsy is a common genetic focal epilepsy of childhood
      characterized by centrotemporal sharp waves on electroencephalogram. In previous 
      genome-wide analysis, we had reported linkage of centrotemporal sharp waves to
      chromosome 11p13, and fine mapping with 44 SNPs identified the ELP4-PAX6 locus in
      two independent US and Canadian case-control samples. Here, we aimed to find a
      causative variant for centrotemporal sharp waves using a larger sample and higher
      resolution genotyping array. METHODS: We fine-mapped the ELP4-PAX6 locus in 186
      individuals from rolandic epilepsy families and 1000 population controls of
      European origin using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. Controls were
      matched to cases on ethnicity using principal component analysis. We used
      generalized estimating equations to assess association, followed up with a
      bioinformatics survey and literature search to evaluate functional significance. 
      RESULTS: Homozygosity at the T allele of SNP rs662702 in the 3' untranslated
      region of PAX6 conferred increased risk of CTS: Odds ratio = 12.29 (95% CI:
      3.20-47.22), P = 2.6 x 10(-4) and is seen in 3.9% of cases but only 0.3% of
      controls. INTERPRETATION: The minor T allele of SNP rs662702 disrupts regulation 
      by microRNA-328, which is known to result in increased PAX6 expression in vitro. 
      This study provides, for the first time, evidence of a noncoding genomic variant 
      contributing to the etiology of a common human epilepsy via a posttranscriptional
      regulatory mechanism.

      chromatin states of the genome as having important roles. METHODS: We genotyped
      355 healthy young individuals for 52 known obesity-associated SNPs and obtained
      DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip.
      Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine residues were
      tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category, and a proxy
      for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used two
      open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n = 62; four brain regions, n = 121-133) 
      and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n = 149). RESULTS: We
      found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with
      methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are
      located in gene promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity
      (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1, NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1,
      RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5, SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC,
      ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1, SH2B1,
      ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly, the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some
      of these genes. We also found that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, our results indicate that some of
      these associations are not blood-specific as we successfully replicated four
      associations in skin fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that 
      many obesity-associated SNPs are associated with proximal gene regulation, which 
      was reflected by association of obesity risk allele genotypes with differential
      DNA methylation. This study highlights the importance of DNA methylation and
      other chromatin marks as a way to understand the molecular basis of genetic
      variants associated with human diseases and traits.

TI  - A familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 11 associated with a microdeletion
      of 163 kb and microduplication of 288 kb at 11p13 and 11q22.3 without aniridia or
      eye anomalies.
PG  - 202-9
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37388 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial deletions of 11p13 involving MPPED2, DCDC5, DCDC1, DNAJC24, IMMP1L, 
      and ELP4 are previously reported to have downstream transcriptional effects on
      the expression of PAX6, due to a downstream regulatory region (DRR). Currently,
      no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have been established allowing for
      conclusive information regarding the exact location of the PAX6 DRR, though its
      location has been approximated in mouse models to be within the Elp4 gene. Of the
      clinical reports currently published examining patients with intact PAX6 genes
      but harboring deletions identified in genes downstream of PAX6, 100% indicate
      phenotypes which include aniridia, whereas approximately half report additional
      eye deformities, autism, or intellectual disability. In this clinical report, we 
      present a 12-year-old male patient, his brother, and mother with pericentric
      inversions of chromosome 11 associated with submicroscopic interstitial deletions
      of 11p13 and duplications of 11q22.3. The inversions were identified by standard 
      cytogenetic analysis; microarray and FISH detected the chromosomal imbalance. The
      patient's phenotype includes intellectual disability, speech abnormalities, and
      autistic behaviors, but interestingly neither the patient, his brother, nor
      mother have aniridia or other eye anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, these 
      findings in three family members represent the only reported cases with 11p13
      deletions downstream of PAX6 not demonstrating phenotypic characteristics of
      aniridia or abnormal eye development. Although none of the deleted genes are
      obvious candidates for the patient's phenotype, the absence of aniridia in the
      presence of this deletion in all three family members further delineates the
      location of the DRR for PAX6.

AB  - Copy-number variations (CNVs) are important in the aetiology of
      neurodevelopmental disorders and show broad phenotypic manifestations. We
      compared the presence of small CNVs disrupting the ELP4-PAX6 locus in 4,092 UK
      individuals with a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, clinically referred
      for array comparative genomic hybridization, with WTCCC controls (n = 4,783). The
      phenotypic analysis was then extended using the DECIPHER database. We followed up
      association using an autism patient cohort (n = 3,143) compared with six
      additional control groups (n = 6,469). In the clinical discovery series, we
      identified eight cases with ELP4 deletions, and one with a partial duplication of
      ELP4 and PAX6. These cases were referred for neurological phenotypes including
      language impairment, developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy. Six further cases
      with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and similar secondary 
      phenotypes were identified with ELP4 deletions, as well as another six (out of
      nine) with neurodevelopmental phenotypes from DECIPHER. CNVs at ELP4 were only
      present in 1/11,252 controls. We found a significant excess of CNVs in discovery 
      cases compared with controls, P = 7.5 x 10(-3) , as well as for autism, P = 2.7 x
      10(-3) . Our results suggest that ELP4 deletions are highly likely to be
      pathogenic, predisposing to a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes from ASD to 
      language impairment and epilepsy.

TI  - Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Identifies Novel Loci Associated
      With Optic Disc Morphology.
PG  - 207-16
LID - 10.1002/gepi.21886 [doi]
AB  - Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common optic neuropathy and an important 
      cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The optic nerve head or optic disc is 
      divided in two parts: a central cup (without nerve fibers) surrounded by the
      neuroretinal rim (containing axons of the retinal ganglion cells). The
      International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium conducted a meta-analysis of
      genome-wide association studies consisting of 17,248 individuals of European
      ancestry and 6,841 individuals of Asian ancestry. The outcomes of the genome-wide
      association studies were disc area and cup area. These specific measurements
      describe optic nerve morphology in another way than the vertical cup-disc ratio, 
      which is a clinically used measurement, and may shed light on new glaucoma
      mechanisms. We identified 10 new loci associated with disc area (CDC42BPA, F5,
      DIRC3, RARB, ABI3BP, DCAF4L2, ELP4, TMTC2, NR2F2, and HORMAD2) and another 10 new
      loci associated with cup area (DHRS3, TRIB2, EFEMP1, FLNB, FAM101, DDHD1, ASB7,
      KPNB1, BCAS3, and TRIOBP). The new genes participate in a number of pathways and 
      future work is likely to identify more functions related to the pathogenesis of
      glaucoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore possible genetic aberrations in a Chinese family with
      aniridia, ptosis and mental retardation, and provide genetic evidence for the
      prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: 14 exons of PAX6 in the proband were sequenced by
      the Sanger sequencing technique. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
      (MLPA) technique was employed to further explore gene alterations of PAX6. Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms-array (SNP-array) assay was applied to screen potential 
      pathologic genome-wide copy number variations (CNV). RESULTS: There were no
      detectable pathogenic mutations in the 14 exons of PAX6 in the proband. MLPA
      indicated a heterozygous deletion encompassing all PAX6 gene regions covered and 
      a partial upstream region. SNP-array assay detected a heterozygous 11p13
      microdeletion with a length of 518 kb in the proband, spanning two whole
      annotated genes, elongation factor protein 4 (ELP4), the paired box gene 6
      (PAX6), and partial IMP1 inner-mitochondrial membrane (IMMP1L) gene. SNP-array
      revealed her affected brother carried the identical deletion. CONCLUSIONS: The
      518 kb heterozygous deletion in 11p13 encompassing PAX6 should be the genetic
      etiology for the familial aniridia.

AB  - Vocal fold lamina propria extracellular matrix (ECM) is highly aligned and when
      injured, becomes disorganized with loss of the tissue's critical biomechanical
      properties. This study examines the effects of electrospun fiber scaffold
      architecture and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP4) coating on human vocal fold
      fibroblast (HVFF) behavior for applications toward tissue engineering the vocal
      fold lamina propria. Electrospun Tecoflex scaffolds were made with aligned and
      unaligned fibers, and were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and
      uniaxial tensile testing. ELP4 was successfully adsorbed onto the scaffolds;
      HVFFs were seeded and their viability, proliferation, morphology and gene
      expression were characterized. Aligned and unaligned scaffolds had initial
      elastic moduli of approximately 14 MPa, approximately 5 MPa and approximately 0.3
      MPa, approximately 0.6 MPa in the preferred and cross-preferred directions,
      respectively. Scaffold topography had an effect on the orientation of the cells, 
      with HVFFs seeded on aligned scaffolds having a significantly different (p<0.001)
      angle of orientation than HVFFs cultured on unaligned scaffolds. This same effect
      and significant difference (p<0.001) was seen on aligned and unaligned scaffolds 
      coated with ELP4. Scaffold alignment and ELP4 coating impacted ECM gene
      expression. ELP4 coating, and aligned scaffolds upregulated elastin synthesis
      when tested on day 7 without a concomitant upregulation of collagen III
      synthesis. Collectively, results indicate that aligned electrospun scaffolds and 
      ELP4 coating are promising candidates in the development of biodegradeable vocal 
      fold lamina propria constructs.

      a Greek population.

AB  - PURPOSE: Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is considered to be
      the most common childhood epileptic syndrome. Different mutations in genes that
      control the excitability of neurons have been described. Recent reports on the
      involvement of the BDNF and ELP4 genes in cell motility, migration, and adhesion 
      raise the possibility that these genes are involved in pathogenesis of BECTS.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control association study on 60
      patients with BECTS and 60 control participants to assess the influence of the
      BDNF and ELP4 polymorphisms on BECTS. The polymorphisms were detected with a
      PCR-RFLP method. Moreover, we explored the possible association of these
      polymorphisms with clinical and electroencephalographic parameters of patients
      with BECTS. RESULTS: Our results show no difference in BDNF and ELP4 genotype
      frequencies between patients and controls. Haplotype analysis also revealed no
      statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The role of BDNF and ELP4 polymorphisms
      remains controversial.

AB  - In this chapter, we will use the concepts and perspective of population genetics 
      and genetic analysis to discuss the trends that are currently popular in the
      epilepsy genetics literature. We will also show that some of the recent
      approaches to understanding epilepsy genetics are unlikely to lead to insight
      into the causes of the most common epilepsies. Much effort has been directed
      toward very rare influences on epilepsy expression and away from approaches that 
      could shed light on the most heritable epilepsies. The latest genetic technology,
      e.g., exome sequencing and copy number variants (CNV) analysis, has been applied 
      without proper consideration of the important principles of population genetics, 
      inheritance, or phenotype definition that are critical in common disease studies.
      We will show that ignoring these issues has led to unlikely suppositions about
      etiology and about which genes should be pursued. We also suggest that, taken
      together, the existing evidence supports a neurodevelopmental origin for common
      epilepsies. We recommend a return to thorough phenotype definition and family
      studies and a more careful and thoughtful application of the new technology.

AB  - Biofilm-forming microorganisms switch between two forms: free-living planktonic
      and sessile multicellular. Sessile communities of yeast biofilms in liquid medium
      provide a primitive example of multicellularity and are clinically important
      because biofilms tend to have other growth characteristics than free-living
      cells. We investigated the genetic basis for yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
      biofilm on solid surfaces in liquid medium by screening a comprehensive deletion 
      mutant collection in the Sigma1278b background and found 71 genes that were
      essential for biofilm development. Quantitative northern blots further revealed
      that AIM1, ASG1, AVT1, DRN1, ELP4, FLO8, FMP10, HMT1, KAR5, MIT1, MRPL32, MSS11, 
      NCP1, NPR1, PEP5, PEX25, RIM8, RIM101, RGT1, SNF8, SPC2, STB6, STP22, TEC1,
      VID24, VPS20, VTC3, YBL029W, YBL029C-A, YFL054C, YGR161W-C, YIL014C-A, YIR024C,
      YKL151C, YNL200C, YOR034C-A, and YOR223W controlled biofilm through FLO11
      induction. Almost all deletion mutants that were unable to form biofilms in
      liquid medium also lost the ability to form surface-spreading biofilm colonies
      (mats) on agar and 69% also lost the ability to grow invasively. The protein
      kinase A isoform Tpk3p functioned specifically in biofilm and mat formation. In a
      tpk3 mutant, transcription of FLO11 was induced three-fold compared with
      wild-type, but biofilm development and cell-cell adhesion was absent, suggesting 
      that Tpk3p regulates FLO11 positive posttranscriptionally and negative
      transcriptionally.The study provides a resource of biofilm-influencing genes for 
      additional research on biofilm development and suggests that the regulation of
      FLO11 is more complex than previously anticipated.

TI  - Analysis of ELP4, SRPX2, and interacting genes in typical and atypical rolandic
      epilepsy.
PG  - e89-93
LID - 10.1111/epi.12712 [doi]
AB  - Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and its atypical variants (atypical rolandic epilepsy,
      ARE) along the spectrum of epilepsy-aphasia disorders are characterized by a
      strong but largely unknown genetic basis. Two genes with a putative (ELP4) or a
      proven (SRPX2) function in neuronal migration were postulated to confer
      susceptibility to parts of the disease spectrum: the ELP4 gene to centrotemporal 
      spikes and SRPX2 to ARE. To reexamine these findings, we investigated a cohort of
      280 patients of European ancestry with RE/ARE for the etiological contribution of
      these genes and their close interaction partners. We performed next-generation
      sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array based genotyping to
      screen for sequence and structural variants. In comparison to European controls
      we could not detect an enrichment of rare deleterious variants of ELP4, SRPX2, or
      their interaction partners in affected individuals. The previously described
      functional p.N327S variant in the X chromosomal SRPX2 gene was detected in two
      affected individuals (0.81%) and also in controls (0.26%), with some
      preponderance of male patients. We did not detect an association of SNPs in the
      ELP4 gene with centrotemporal spikes as previously reported. In conclusion our
      data do not support a major role of ELP4 and SRPX2 in the etiology of RE/ARE.

TI  - Evaluation of the bulk platelet response and fibrinogen interaction to
      elastin-like polypeptide coatings.
PG  - 540-51
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.34699 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we expand on our understanding of the thrombogenicity of coatings
      prepared with three different recombinant elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). The
      bulk platelet response of the ELP coatings was characterized following whole
      blood contact under physiological shear flow (300 s(-1) ) using flow cytometry.
      Prolonged exposure to shear flow (1-h) indicated that materials coated with the
      longer ELP coatings (ELP2 and ELP4) had less bulk platelet activation and
      microparticle formation than materials coated with the shorter ELP1. Quartz
      crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to monitor the binding of 
      the platelet membrane receptor GPIIb/IIIa to ELP-adsorbed fibrinogen (Fg)
      surfaces. Compared to the shorter ELPs, a lower amount of Fg adsorbed to the ELP4
      coated material and ELP4 appeared to form a softer, more structurally flexible
      coating layer. When Fg was adsorbed to the ELP coated surface it demonstrated an 
      altered binding for GPIIb/IIIa that was inhibited in the presence of an
      AGDV-containing peptide but not an RGD-containing peptide. Conversely, on the
      shorter ELP coatings, binding of GPIIb/IIIa to an adsorbed Fg layer was partially
      inhibited in the presence of an RGD-containing peptide. These results indicate
      that both the quantity and conformational state of Fg varies when adsorbed to
      surfaces coated with ELPs of varying sequence length, which may be mediating
      their platelet response. Collectively, the findings reinforce the applicability
      of the ELPs as potential thromboresistant coatings, especially with the use of
      the longer polypeptide-ELP4.

LID - 10.1007/s10856-012-4772-6 [doi]
AB  - The surface properties of a family of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), differing
      in molecular weight and sequence length, were investigated to understand how the 
      nature of the polypeptide film might contribute to their thrombogenic profile.
      Physical adsorption of the ELPs onto Mylar increased surface wettability as the
      sequence length decreased while X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed an increasing 
      amide content with sequence length. Chemical force microscopy analysis revealed
      that the ELP-coated surfaces displayed purely hydrophilic adhesion forces that
      increased as the ELP sequence length decreased. Adsorption isotherms performed
      using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, showed that the surface
      coverage increased with ELP sequence length. The longer polypeptides (ELP2 and
      ELP4) also displayed higher specific dissipation values indicating that they
      established films with greater structural flexibility and associated water
      content than the shorter polypeptide, ELP1. Additionally, the stability of the
      ELP coating was lower with the shorter polypeptides. This study highlights the
      different surface properties of the ELP coatings as well as the dynamic nature of
      the ELP adsorbed layer wherein the conformational state may be an important
      factor contributing to their blood response.

      indirectly regulates numerous biological processes ranging from exocytosis and
      resistance to heat shock in yeast to cell migration and neuronal differentiation 
      in higher eukaryotes. The identity of human ELP1 through ELP4 has been reported
      but human ELP5 and ELP6 have remained uncharacterized. Here, we report that DERP6
      (ELP5) and C3ORF75 (ELP6) encode these subunits of human Elongator. We further
      investigated the importance and function of these two subunits by a combination
      of biochemical analysis and cellular assays. Our results show that DERP6/ELP5 is 
      required for the integrity of Elongator and directly connects ELP3 to ELP4.
      Importantly, the migration and tumorigenicity of melanoma-derived cells are
      significantly decreased upon Elongator depletion through ELP1 or ELP3.
      Strikingly, DERP6/ELP5 and C3ORF75/ELP6-depleted melanoma cells have similar
      defects, further supporting the idea that DERP6/ELP5 and C3ORF75/ELP6 are
      essential for Elongator function. Together, our data identify DERP6/ELP5 and
      C3ORF75/ELP6 as key players for migration, invasion and tumorigenicity of
      melanoma cells, as integral subunits of Elongator.

AB  - BECTS is considered to be the most common childhood epileptic syndrome.
      Multifactorial inheritance is the most important model accounting for the genetic
      behavior of the common epilepsies. In recent years, different mutations in genes 
      that control the excitability of neurons have been described. Recent reports on
      the involvement of the BDNF and ELP4 genes with possible roles in cell motility, 
      migration, and adhesion have provided first insights into the complex molecular
      bases of childhood focal epilepsies. However, in the most common idiopathic
      benign childhood epilepsies (BECTS and occipital epilepsies), major breakthroughs
      are still awaited.

TI  - Major Susceptibility Genes for Common Idiopathic Epilepsies: ELP4 in Rolandic
      Epilepsy and BRD2 in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy
BTI - Jasper's Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies
AB  - Clinical observations confirm that the idiopathic epilepsies are
      neurodevelopmental disorders strongly influenced by genetic factors. Genetic
      epidemiological studies prove major genetic influences on two common forms of
      idiopathic epilepsy to be discussed here: rolandic epilepsy (RE) and juvenile
      myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The common forms of these idiopathic syndromes have a
      complex genetic inheritance and this fact complicates finding and elucidating the
      susceptibility genes as well as proving their pathogenic role. Genetic
      heterogeneity and phenotype definition are much more serious factors in studying 
      common complex epilepsies than they are in the study of densely affected epilepsy
      pedigrees showing Mendelian inheritance. In complex disorders, several genes and 
      sometimes environmental factors are believed to contribute to disease etiology;
      as a result, proving a causative role for any one gene, in a genetic model
      involving multiple genes, can present a challenge. In this chapter, we first
      review the methodological issues associated with analyzing complex genetic
      disorders, then explain the strategy that we have used in investigating these two
      particular syndromes. Genomewide linkage analyses and fine-mapping have resulted 
      in the identification of susceptibility genes ELP4 in Rolandic epilepsy and BRD2 
      in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We discuss the evidence in favor of a pathogenic 
      role for each gene and the further steps that are required to establish
      causality.

PG  - 21501-8
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.341560 [doi]
AB  - Elongator is a multiprotein complex composed of two subcomplexes, Elp1-3 and
      Elp4-6. Elongator is highly conserved between yeast and humans and plays an
      important role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcriptional elongation and many 
      other processes, including cytoskeleton organization, exocytosis, and tRNA
      modification. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the Elp4-6 subcomplex 
      of yeast. The overall structure of Elp4-6 revealed that Elp6 acts as a bridge to 
      assemble Elp4 and Elp5. Detailed structural and sequence analyses revealed that
      each subunit in the Elp4-6 subcomplex forms a RecA-ATPase-like fold, although it 
      lacks the key sequence signature of ATPases. Site-directed mutagenesis and
      biochemical analyses indicated that the Elp4-6 subcomplex can assemble into a
      hexameric ring-shaped structure in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, GST pulldown
      assays showed that the ring-shaped assembly of the Elp4-6 subcomplex is important
      for its specific histone H3 binding. Our results may shed light on the substrate 
      recognition and assembly of the holo-Elongator complex.

TI  - Electrospun elastin-like polypeptide enriched polyurethanes and their
      interactions with vascular smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 2493-503
LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2012.03.032 [doi]
AB  - In vascular tissue, elastin is an essential extracellular matrix protein that
      plays an important biomechanical and biological signalling role. Native elastin
      is insoluble and is difficult to extract from tissues, which results in its
      relatively rare use for the fabrication of vascular tissue engineering scaffolds.
      Recombinant elastin-like polypeptide-4 (ELP4), which mimics the structure and
      function of native tropoelastin, represents a practical alternative to the native
      elastic fibre for vascular applications. In this study, electrospinning was
      utilized to fabricate fibrous scaffolds which were subsequently surface modified 
      with ELP4 and used as substrates for smooth muscle cell culture. ELP4 surface
      modified materials demonstrated enhanced smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion and
      maintenance of cell numbers over a 1-week period relative to controls. SMCs
      seeded on the ELP4 surface modified materials were also shown to exhibit the cell
      morphology and biological markers of a contractile phenotype including a
      spindle-like morphology, actin filament organization and smooth muscle myosin
      heavy chain expression. Competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that the 
      elastin-laminin cell surface receptor and its affinity for the VGVAPG peptide
      sequence on ELP4 molecules are likely involved in the initial SMC contact with
      the ELP4 modified materials. Elastin-like polypeptides show promise as surface
      modifiers for candidate scaffolds for engineering contractile vascular tissues.

TI  - The Elongator subcomplex Elp456 is a hexameric RecA-like ATPase.
PG  - 314-20
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2234 [doi]
AB  - Elongator was initially described as an RNA polymerase II-associated factor but
      has since been associated with a broad range of cellular activities. It has also 
      attracted clinical attention because of its role in certain neurodegenerative
      diseases. Here we describe the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      subcomplex of Elongator proteins 4, 5 and 6 (Elp456). The subunits each show
      almost identical RecA folds that form a heterohexameric ring-like structure
      resembling hexameric RecA-like ATPases. This structural finding is supported by
      different complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches, including the specific
      binding of the hexameric Elp456 subcomplex to tRNAs in a manner regulated by ATP.
      Our results support a role of Elongator in tRNA modification, explain the
      importance of each of the Elp4, Elp5 and Elp6 subunits for complex integrity and 
      suggest a model for the overall architecture of the holo-Elongator complex.

TI  - A genetic epidemiologic study of candidate genes involved in the optic nerve head
      morphology.
PG  - 1485-91
LID - 10.1167/iovs.11-7384 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The size of the optic nerve head, referred to as disc area (DA), and the
      vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR), are clinically relevant parameters for
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although these measures have a high heritability, 
      little is known about the underlying genes. Previously, the genes SALL1 and SIX1 
      were found to be genome-wide significantly associated with DA and VCDR. The
      purpose of the present study was to investigate whether genes encoding protein
      known to interact with protein encoded by SALL1 and SIX1 are also associated with
      either DA or VCDR. METHODS: A total of 38 candidate genes were chosen covering
      all known proteins interacting with SALL1 and SIX1. These were initially studied 
      in the Rotterdam Study (RS)-I, including 5312 Caucasian subjects characterized
      for DA and VCDR. Positive findings were further investigated in two independent
      cohorts (RS-II and RS-III) and finally replicated in a fourth population (ERF).
      Bonferroni correction was applied to the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Three loci were 
      found to be associated with DA. The only locus significant after correcting for
      multiple testing is located on chromosome 11p13. Three single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in ELP4, a gene which neighbors and plays a crucial role in 
      the expression of PAX6, show association in meta-analysis of the four cohorts
      yielding P values of respectively 4.79 x 10(-6), 3.92 x 10(-6), and 4.88 x 10(-6)
      which is below the threshold dictated by the most conservative Bonferroni
      correction (P = 5.2 x 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the
      ELP4-PAX6 region plays a role in the DA. Further research to confirm this finding
      is needed.

AB  - Platelet adhesion and activation are important early markers of biomaterial blood
      compatibility, while surfaces that promote enhanced endothelial cell adhesion and
      eNOS expression are strategic targets for long term vascular graft applications. 
      Materials surface modified with fluorinated surface modifiers, containing
      peptides inspired from elastin cross-linking domains, have been used for the
      cross-linking of elastin-like polypeptide 4 (ELP4) macromolecules onto
      polyurethane surfaces. In the present study, ELP4 modified polyurethanes were
      evaluated in vitro to assess platelet adhesion, microparticle formation and bulk 
      platelet activation following blood-material interactions. Reduced platelet
      adhesion and bulk platelet activation were observed following contact between
      reconstituted human blood and the ELP4 materials, relative to the uncoated base
      polyurethane controls. ELP4 modified materials also promoted endothelial cell
      adhesion and retention over a period of one week and showed that the endothelial 
      cells exhibited an organized actin cytoskeleton and enhanced endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase (eNOS) expression relative to the control surfaces. These results 
      indicate that polyurethane elastomers modified with ELP4 covalently bound to
      fluorinated surface modifiers provide a promising approach for endowing synthetic
      elastomers with both reduced blood platelet activation properties and enhanced
      endothelial cell adhesion for potential use in vascular graft applications.

TI  - Large novel deletions detected in Chinese families with aniridia: correlation
      between genotype and phenotype.
PG  - 548-57
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical and genetic findings in two Chinese families
      with aniridia and other ocular abnormalities. METHODS: Two unrelated families
      were examined clinically. After informed consent was obtained, genomic DNA was
      extracted from the venous blood of all participants. Mutation screening of all
      exons of the PAX6 (paired box gene 6) gene was performed by direct sequencing of 
      PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
      (MLPA) was performed to detect large deletions. Linkage analysis was used to
      validate the large deletions revealed by MLPA in all available family members.
      RESULTS: Clinical examination and pedigree analysis revealed one four-generation 
      family (85) and one three- generation family (86) with total aniridia, congenital
      cataracts, foveal hypoplasia, and glaucoma. No mutation in PAX6 was identified
      after PCR-sequencing. Through MLPA analysis, a large deletion including the whole
      PAX6 gene, DKFZp686k1684 (hypothetical LOC440034), and the RCN1 (reticulocalbin
      1) gene was detected in family 85; a 3' deletion to the PAX6 gene including the
      ELP4 (elongator complex protein 4) and the DCDC1 (doublecortin domain containing 
      1) gene was identified in family 86.The two large deletions were confirmed with
      linkage analysis and the "loss of heterozygous" in the different PAX6 regions
      were co-segregated with the phenotype of the two families, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the PAX6 contiguous gene deletion, including the RCN1 
      gene, presented more severe vision impairments than those carrying the PAX6 3'
      deletion. Large deletions may account for several Chinese families and sporadic
      cases with aniridia and screening for these kinds of alterations should be
      included in aniridia patients' analyses.

TI  - A 556 kb deletion in the downstream region of the PAX6 gene causes familial
      aniridia and other eye anomalies in a Chinese family.
PG  - 448-55
AB  - PURPOSE: The paired box gene 6 (PAX6) on human chromosome 11p13 is an essential
      transcription factor for eye formation in animals. Mutations in PAX6 can lead to 
      varieties of autosomal-dominant ocular malformations with aniridia as the major
      clinical signs. Known genetic alterations causing haplo-insufficiency of PAX6
      include nonsense mutations, frame-shift mutations, splicing errors, or genomic
      deletions. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic defects as the
      underlying cause of familial aniridia in a large Chinese family. METHODS: All
      exons of PAX6 in the proband were sequenced by the Sanger sequencing technique.
      The genome of the proband was evaluated by a microarray-based comparative genomic
      hybridization (aCGH). Quantitative real-time PCR was applied to verify the
      abnormal aCGH findings in the proband and to test five other family members.
      RESULTS: There were no detectable pathogenic mutations in the exons of PAX6 in
      the proband. The aCGH analysis showed two copies of PAX6 but revealed a 566 kb
      hemizygous deletion of chromosome 11p13, including four annotated genes
      doublecortin domain containing 1 (DCDC1), DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 24
      (DNAJC24), IMP1 inner mitochondrial membrane(IMMP1L), andelongation factor
      protein 4 (ELP4) downstream of PAX6. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the
      deletion in the proband and further identified the deletion in a blind fashion in
      four affected family members but not in the one with a normal phenotype.
      CONCLUSIONS: The 566 kb hemizygous deletion of chromosome 11p13 downstream of
      PAX6 should be the cause of the familial aniridia in this Chinese family,
      although two copies of PAX6 are intact. aCGH evaluation should be applied if
      there is a negative result for the mutation detection of PAX6 in patients with
      aniridia.

LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.33022 [doi]
AB  - Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) surface modification represents a valuable
      approach for the development of biomaterials in a wide range of medical
      applications. In this study, ELP surface modification has been achieved through
      the use of elastin cross-linking peptide (ECP) bioactive fluorinated surface
      modifiers (ECP-BFSMs). The synthesis of low molecular weight fluorinated
      additives was described and their subsequent blending with a base polycarbonate
      urethane (PCNU) was shown to successfully enrich the surface to allow for ELP
      surface cross-linking via lysine moieties on the peptide segments of the
      ECP-BFSMs. The kinetics for the surface migration of fluorescent ECP-BFSMs was
      studied over a 2-week period by two-photon confocal microscopy. A decrease in
      advancing contact angle from 87.9 degrees to 75.3 degrees was observed for
      ECP-BFSM modified PCNU and was associated with the presence of ECP peptides on
      the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated an increase in surface
      atomic percent of fluorine (from 0.2 to 7.2%) and nitrogen (from 1.0 to 3.0%)
      associated with the surface localization of fluoro groups and amide groups
      associated with the peptides in the ECP-BFSMs. A further increase in surface
      atomic percent of nitrogen (from 3.0 to 8.3%) was observed after ELP surface
      cross-linking. These ELP-modified surfaces were shown to promote increased smooth
      muscle cell adhesion, spreading and retention over a 7-day culture period
      relative to their non-ELP4 analogs. This novel surface modifying additive
      approach may be used for various biomimetic applications since it generates a
      stable ECM-like surface retained onto a relatively inert fluorinated background.

TI  - Pleiotropic effects of the 11p13 locus on developmental verbal dyspraxia and EEG 
      centrotemporal sharp waves.
PG  - 1004-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2010.00648.x [doi]
AB  - We recently showed genomewide linkage of centrotemporal sharp waves (CTS) in
      classic Rolandic epilepsy (RE) families to chromosome 11p13, and fine-mapped this
      locus to variants in the ELP4 gene. Speech sound disorder (SSD) is a common
      comorbidity in RE subjects, of unknown etiology, which co-aggregates in family
      members in a manner that could hypothetically be explained by shared underlying
      genetic risk with CTS. Furthermore, the neural mechanism of SSD is unknown,
      although individuals with rare, Mendelian forms of RE are described with severe
      verbal and oromotor apraxia. We therefore first performed genomewide linkage
      analysis for SSD, operationally defined as clinical history consistent with
      ICD-10 speech articulation disorder, in 38 families singly ascertained through a 
      proband with RE. We tested the hypothesis of shared genetic risk with CTS at the 
      11p13 locus. In the second part of the study we used computerized acoustic
      analysis of recorded speech to test the hypothesis of dyspraxia as a mechanism
      for SSD in a smaller subset of RE probands and relatives. In two-point and
      multipoint LOD score analysis, we found that evidence for linkage to the 11p13
      locus increased substantially when the phenotype was broadened from CTS to
      CTS/SSD. In multipoint analysis, the LOD score rose by 3.2 to HLOD 7.54 at
      D11S914 for CTS/SSD, the same marker at which multipoint linkage maximized for
      CTS alone. Non-parametric, affected-only methods in a sub-set of the data provide
      further confirmatory evidence for pleiotropy. In acoustic analysis there were
      voice-onset time abnormalities in 10/18 RE probands, 8/16 siblings and 5/15
      parents, providing evidence of breakdown in the spatial/temporal properties of
      speech articulation consistent with a dyspraxic mechanism. The results from
      genetic and physiological studies suggest a pleiotropic role for the 11p13 locus 
      in the development of both SSD and CTS, and also indicate a dyspraxic mechanism
      for the SSD linked to 11p13. Taken together, these data strongly support a
      neurodevelopmental origin for classic RE.

AB  - Previous work in our laboratory showed the potential of using a human recombinant
      elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) as a thromboresistant coating. In this work we
      investigate the use of three particular ELPs (ELP1, ELP2 and ELP4), that differ
      by molecular weight and number of repeating hydrophobic and cross-linking
      domains, as coatings to improve blood-contacting properties. All three ELPs were 
      passively adsorbed on Mylar surfaces. Differences in water contact angle and
      surface concentration were found among the three ELP coatings, with the shortest 
      polypeptide, ELP1, being the most hydrophilic and abundant on the surface (55
      degrees , 0.76 mug/cm(2)), followed by ELP2 (55 degrees , 0.35 mug/cm(2)) and
      ELP4, the longest of the three (66 degrees , 0.25 mug/cm(2)), respectively. The
      blood interactions of the ELP coatings were investigated by measuring fibrinogen 
      adsorption and platelet adhesion in whole blood under laminar flow in a cone and 
      plate viscometer configuration. In general, platelet adhesion to the ELP-coated
      surfaces was found to correlate with fibrinogen adsorption. Decreases in
      fibrinogen accretion and platelet adhesion were observed for ELP-coated compared 
      to uncoated surfaces. The magnitude of the decreases was found to depend on the
      ELP sequence length, with ELP4 exhibiting the lowest levels of fibrinogen
      adsorption and platelet adhesion at 43 +/- 24 ng/cm(2) and 113 +/- 77
      platelets/mm(2), respectively.

      alternative to Bayesian and frequentist analysis.
PG  - 933-41
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.47 [doi]
AB  - Investigators performing genetic association studies grapple with how to measure 
      strength of association evidence, choose sample size, and adjust for multiple
      testing. We apply the evidential paradigm (EP) to genetic association studies,
      highlighting its strengths. The EP uses likelihood ratios (LRs), as opposed to
      P-values or Bayes' factors, to measure strength of association evidence. We
      derive EP methodology to estimate sample size, adjust for multiple testing, and
      provide informative graphics for drawing inferences, as illustrated with a
      Rolandic Epilepsy (RE) fine-mapping study. We focus on controlling the
      probability of observing weak evidence for or against association (W) rather than
      type I errors (M). For example, for LR> or =32 representing strong evidence, at
      one locus with n=200 cases, n=200 controls, W=0.134, whereas M=0.005. For n=300
      cases and controls, W=0.039 and M=0.004. These calculations are based on
      detecting an OR=1.5. Despite the common misconception, one is not tied to this
      planning value for analysis; rather one calculates the likelihood at all possible
      values to assess evidence for association. We provide methodology to adjust for
      multiple tests across m loci, which adjusts M and W for m. We do so for (a)
      single-stage designs, (b) two-stage designs, and (c) simultaneously controlling
      family-wise error rate (FWER) and W. Method (c) chooses larger sample sizes than 
      (a) or (b), whereas (b) has smaller bounds on the FWER than (a). The EP, using
      our innovative graphical display, identifies important SNPs in elongator protein 
      complex 4 (ELP4) associated with RE that may not have been identified using
      standard approaches.

TI  - Plant Elongator regulates auxin-related genes during RNA polymerase II
      transcription elongation.
PG  - 1678-83
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0913559107 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, transcription of protein-encoding genes is strongly regulated by
      posttranslational modifications of histones that affect the accessibility of the 
      DNA by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The Elongator complex was originally
      identified in yeast as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex that activates
      RNAPII-mediated transcription. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the Elongator mutants
      elo1, elo2, and elo3 with decreased leaf and primary root growth due to reduced
      cell proliferation identified homologs of components of the yeast Elongator
      complex, Elp4, Elp1, and Elp3, respectively. Here we show that the Elongator
      complex was purified from plant cell cultures as a six-component complex. The
      role of plant Elongator in transcription elongation was supported by
      colocalization of the HAT enzyme, ELO3, with euchromatin and the phosphorylated
      form of RNAPII, and reduced histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation at the coding region
      of the SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 auxin repressor and the LAX2 auxin influx carrier gene
      with reduced expression levels in the elo3 mutant. Additional auxin-related genes
      were down-regulated in the transcriptome of elo mutants but not targeted by the
      Elongator HAT activity showing specificity in target gene selection. Biological
      relevance was apparent by auxin-related phenotypes and marker gene analysis.
      Ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling and abiotic stress responses were
      up-regulated in the elo transcriptome and might contribute to the pleiotropic elo
      phenotype. Thus, although the structure of Elongator and its substrate are
      conserved, target gene selection has diverged, showing that auxin signaling and
      influx are under chromatin control.

TI  - A role for the elongator complex in zygotic paternal genome demethylation.
PG  - 554-8
LID - 10.1038/nature08732 [doi]
AB  - The life cycle of mammals begins when a sperm enters an egg. Immediately after
      fertilization, both the maternal and paternal genomes undergo dramatic
      reprogramming to prepare for the transition from germ cell to somatic cell
      transcription programs. One of the molecular events that takes place during this 
      transition is the demethylation of the paternal genome. Despite extensive
      efforts, the factors responsible for paternal DNA demethylation have not been
      identified. To search for such factors, we developed a live cell imaging system
      that allows us to monitor the paternal DNA methylation state in zygotes. Through 
      short-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown in mouse zygotes, we identified Elp3
      (also called KAT9), a component of the elongator complex, to be important for
      paternal DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that knockdown of Elp3 impairs
      paternal DNA demethylation as indicated by reporter binding, immunostaining and
      bisulphite sequencing. Similar results were also obtained when other elongator
      components, Elp1 and Elp4, were knocked down. Importantly, injection of messenger
      RNA encoding the Elp3 radical SAM domain mutant, but not the HAT domain mutant,
      into MII oocytes before fertilization also impaired paternal DNA demethylation,
      indicating that the SAM radical domain is involved in the demethylation process. 
      Our study not only establishes a critical role for the elongator complex in
      zygotic paternal genome demethylation, but also indicates that the demethylation 
      process may be mediated through a reaction that requires an intact radical SAM
      domain.

TI  - Human Elongator complex is involved in cell cycle and suppresses cell growth in
      293T human embryonic kidney cells.
PG  - 831-8
AB  - Elongator complex has been associated with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II 
      and is known to play critical roles in transcriptional elongation, as well as in 
      tRNA modification and exocytosis. However, the specific mechanism of how human
      Elongator complex regulates cell growth and cell cycle remains unclear. To
      investigate the composition of human Elongator complex and its effects on cell
      growth, 293T cells were established that stably overexpressed Flag-Elp3 and
      Flag-Elp4. By using anti-Flag M2 antibody-bound resin, a core Elongator complex
      was purified from cells that stably overexpressed Flag-Elp3. No Elongator complex
      was purified from cells stably transfected with pFlagCMV4-Elp4. Interestingly,
      the cell growth was inhibited in 293T cells transfected with pFlagCMV4- Elp3.
      Flow cytometry analysis showed that most of the cells stably overexpressing
      Flag-Elp3 were found in G1 stage, indicating a role of the core Elongator in the 
      G1 checkpoint for the regulation of cell cycle. We observed increased basal
      transcription and remarkably enhanced transcription stimulated by VP16 in 293T
      cells overexpressing Flag-Elp3. The transcription could also be synergistically
      activated by overexpressing both Elp3 and Elp4. Taken together, our results
      suggested that the core Elongator complex formed by Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 was
      rather stable, whereas Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 might loosely contact and work
      together with the core Elongator to regulate cell functions.

TI  - From rolandic epilepsy to continuous spike-and-waves during sleep and
      Landau-Kleffner syndromes: insights into possible genetic factors.
PG  - 25-8

AB  - Epilepsy is a frequent neurologic disease in childhood, characterized by
      recurrent seizures and sometimes with major effects on social, behavioral, and
      cognitive development. Childhood focal epilepsies particularly are age-related
      diseases mainly occurring during developmental critical periods. A complex
      interplay between brain development and maturation processes and susceptibility
      genes may contribute to the development of various childhood epileptic syndromes 
      associated with language and cognitive deficits. Indeed, the Landau-Kleffner
      syndrome (LKS), the continuous spike-and-waves during sleep syndrome (CSWS), and 
      the benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) or benign
      rolandic epilepsy, are different entities that are considered as part of a single
      continuous spectrum of disorders. Genetic predisposition with simple to complex
      modes of inheritance has long been suspected for this wide group of childhood
      focal epilepsies. Recent reports on the involvement of the SRPX2 and ELP4 genes
      with possible roles in cell motility, migration, and adhesion have provided first
      insights into the complex molecular bases of childhood focal epilepsies.

TI  - Elongator mediates ABA responses, oxidative stress resistance and anthocyanin
      biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 79-90

AB  - Elongator is a histone acetyl-transferase complex consisting of six subunits, and
      is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms. Here, we isolated two novel mutants,
      elp2 and elp6, during a genetic screening for ABA-hypersensitive Arabidopsis
      mutants. Map-based cloning identified ELP2 and ELP6, which encode the orthologs
      of the yeast Elongator subunits, ELP2 and ELP6, respectively. Another Elongator
      subunit mutant, elp4/elo1, was obtained from the SALK T-DNA collection. The
      elp1/abo1/elo2 mutant was isolated in a previous study. All four of the Elongator
      mutants had narrow leaves, reduced root growth, ABA hypersensitivity and an
      increased accumulation of anthocyanins. Mutations in the core subcomplex subunits
      ELP1/ABO1 and ELP2, but not in the accessory subcomplex subunits ELP4/ELO1 and
      ELP6, caused stomatal closing to be supersensitive to ABA. In addition, the four 
      mutants were all more resistant than the wild type to oxidative stress produced
      by methyl viologen, and to CsCl. Gene expression analysis indicated that the four
      mutants had increased transcript levels of CAT3 under normal conditions,
      increased transcript levels of ZAT10 when treated with ABA and reduced transcript
      levels of MYBL2, which encodes a single-repeat MYB protein, acting as a negative 
      regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our results suggest that Elongator plays
      crucial roles in regulating plant responses to ABA, oxidative stress resistance
      and anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Centrotemporal sharp wave EEG trait in rolandic epilepsy maps to Elongator
      Protein Complex 4 (ELP4).
PG  - 1171-81
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2008.267 [doi]
AB  - Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common human epilepsy, affecting children
      between 3 and 12 years of age, boys more often than girls (3:2). Focal sharp
      waves in the centrotemporal area define the electroencephalographic (EEG) trait
      for the syndrome, are a feature of several related childhood epilepsies and are
      frequently observed in common developmental disorders (eg, speech dyspraxia,
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental coordination
      disorder). Here we report the first genome-wide linkage scan in RE for the EEG
      trait, centrotemporal sharp waves (CTS), with genome-wide linkage of CTS to 11p13
      (HLOD 4.30). Pure likelihood statistical analysis refined our linkage peak by
      fine mapping CTS to variants in Elongator Protein Complex 4 (ELP4) in two
      independent data sets; the strongest evidence was with rs986527 in intron 9 of
      ELP4, providing a likelihood ratio of 629:1 (P=0.0002) in favor of an
      association. Resequencing of ELP4 coding, flanking and promoter regions revealed 
      no significant exonic polymorphisms. This is the first report of a gene
      implicated in a common focal epilepsy and the first human disease association of 
      ELP4. ELP4 is a component of the Elongator complex, involved in transcription and
      tRNA modification. Elongator depletion results in the brain-specific
      downregulation of genes implicated in cell motility and migration. We hypothesize
      that a non-coding mutation in ELP4 impairs brain-specific Elongator-mediated
      interaction of genes implicated in brain development, resulting in susceptibility
      to seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders.

PG  - 785-99
LID - 10.1163/156856208784522038 [doi]
AB  - Recombinantly-engineered elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) possess many of the
      favourable attributes of the native elastin protein, making them an attractive
      option for designing biomaterials for tissue-engineering applications. The focus 
      of this study was to synthesize and characterise the bulk material properties of 
      two ELP sequences, ELP2 and ELP4, cross-linked with lysine diisocyanate (LDI).
      The two distinct ELPs consist of repeating hydrophobic and hydrophilic
      cross-linking domains in a block co-polymer structure, however, differ by the
      number of respective domains. Depending on the conditions sets for the
      cross-linking reactions, two different ELP-based materials were synthesized: a
      gel-like relatively non-porous material and a porous foam-like material, from
      both ELP sequences. The physical material properties were characterised by
      scanning electron microscopy, compression testing, differential calorimetry
      analysis and swelling analysis. The bulk material properties were found to vary
      depending on the ELP sequence investigated. ELP gels were also found to have a
      more dense solidified morphology, lower compressive moduli, higher melting
      temperature and greater swelling capacity than the porous ELP foams. These novel 
      cross-linked bio-elastomeric materials show promising properties for soft tissue 
      replacement, particularly in load-bearing applications.

TI  - Subfunctionalization of duplicated zebrafish pax6 genes by cis-regulatory
      divergence.
PG  - e29
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.0040029 [doi]
AB  - Gene duplication is a major driver of evolutionary divergence. In most
      vertebrates a single PAX6 gene encodes a transcription factor required for eye,
      brain, olfactory system, and pancreas development. In zebrafish, following a
      postulated whole-genome duplication event in an ancestral teleost, duplicates
      pax6a and pax6b jointly fulfill these roles. Mapping of the homozygously viable
      eye mutant sunrise identified a homeodomain missense change in pax6b, leading to 
      loss of target binding. The mild phenotype emphasizes role-sharing between the
      co-orthologues. Meticulous mapping of isolated BACs identified perturbed synteny 
      relationships around the duplicates. This highlights the functional conservation 
      of pax6 downstream (3') control sequences, which in most vertebrates reside
      within the introns of a ubiquitously expressed neighbour gene, ELP4, whose
      pax6a-linked exons have been lost in zebrafish. Reporter transgenic studies in
      both mouse and zebrafish, combined with analysis of vertebrate sequence
      conservation, reveal loss and retention of specific cis-regulatory elements,
      correlating strongly with the diverged expression of co-orthologues, and
      providing clear evidence for evolution by subfunctionalization.

TI  - A deletion 3' to the PAX6 gene in familial aniridia cases.
PG  - 1245-50
AB  - PURPOSE: PAX6 mutations cause aniridia as well as other various congenital eye
      abnormalities. Aniridia can be due to both point mutations and chromosomal
      deletions/rearrangements. Therefore, a complete search for PAX6 gene alterations 
      in aniridia subjects requires a technically complex approach involving the
      comprehension of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In the
      present study, an Italian casistic of aniridia patients has been investigated and
      a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect PAX6 gene
      deletions was set up. METHODS: Twenty-one aniridia patients were screened for
      point mutations (missense, nonsense, splicing-affecting, and short
      insertion/deletion) by using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
      and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). To reveal
      deletions not detectable by SSCP or dHPLC, a quantitative PCR approach was set up
      for the PAX6 structural gene and for regions 5' and 3' to it at the level of WT1 
      and ELP4, respectively. RESULTS: Point mutations were found in 7 out of 21
      patients. Three out of twenty-one patients showed deletions at the level of the
      PAX6 structural gene. In addition, two familial cases showed an undamaged PAX6
      gene but a deletion in the region 3' to it at level of the ELP4 gene. In one of
      the families, the presence of the deletion has been confirmed by linkage analysis
      of polymorphic markers. CONCLUSIONS: In our casistic, a significant fraction of
      familial aniridia patients appears to be caused by a 3' deletion to PAX6,
      suggesting that evaluation of this alteration should be included in routine
      procedures of aniridia patients analysis. The quantitative PCR assay described
      here represents a simple approach to accomplish this task.

TI  - The elongata mutants identify a functional Elongator complex in plants with a
      role in cell proliferation during organ growth.
PG  - 7754-9
AB  - The key enzyme for transcription of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes is RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII). The recruitment of this enzyme during transcription
      initiation and its passage along the template during transcription elongation is 
      regulated through the association and dissociation of several complexes.
      Elongator is a histone acetyl transferase complex, consisting of six subunits
      (ELP1-ELP6), that copurifies with the elongating RNAPII in yeast and humans. We
      demonstrate that point mutations in three Arabidopsis thaliana genes, encoding
      homologs of the yeast Elongator subunits ELP1, ELP3 (histone acetyl transferase),
      and ELP4 are responsible for the phenotypes of the elongata2 (elo2), elo3, and
      elo1 mutants, respectively. The elo mutants are characterized by narrow leaves
      and reduced root growth that results from a decreased cell division rate.
      Morphological and molecular phenotypes show that the ELONGATA (ELO) genes
      function in the same biological process and the epistatic interactions between
      the ELO genes can be explained by the model of complex formation in yeast.
      Furthermore, the plant Elongator complex is genetically positioned in the process
      of RNAPII-mediated transcription downstream of Mediator. Our data indicate that
      the Elongator complex is evolutionarily conserved in structure and function but
      reveal that the mechanism by which it stimulates cell proliferation is different 
      in yeast and plants.

TI  - [The Elp4 subunit of human Elongator complex partially complements the growth
      defects of yeast ELP4 deletion strain].
PG  - 668-74
AB  - In this study, we performed in vivo experiments to determine the function of
      human Elongator subunit Elp4 by using a yeast complementary system. Our results
      indicated that though human ELP4 was not able to complement the growth defects of
      the ELP4 deletion mutant strain to high concentration salt, it partially reduced 
      the sensitivity of mutant strain to caffeine, high temperature and 6-AU. Gene
      expression analysis indicated that human ELP4 partially resumed the slow
      activation of the PHO5 gene caused by the deletion of yELP4 under the low
      phosphate concentration. Meanwhile, under the condition of heat shock treatment, 
      hELP4 increased the expression level of SSA3 gene. All these data demonstrated
      that human ELP4 can partially complement the growth defects and restore the slow 
      activation of certain genes of the yELP4 deletion strain. These results indicate 
      that human Elp4 subunit has similar functions to that of the yeast.

TI  - Molecular architecture, structure-function relationship, and importance of the
      Elp3 subunit for the RNA binding of holo-elongator.
PG  - 32087-92
AB  - The molecular architecture of six-subunit yeast holo-Elongator complex was
      investigated by the use of immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid interaction mapping,
      and in vitro studies of binary interactions between individual subunits.
      Surprisingly, Elp2 is dispensable for the integrity of the holo-Elongator
      complex, and a purified five-subunit elp2 Delta Elongator complex retains histone
      acetyltransferase activity in vitro. These results indicate that the WD40 repeats
      in Elp2 are required neither for subunit-subunit interactions within Elongator
      nor for Elongator interaction with histones during catalysis. Elp2 and Elp4 were 
      largely dispensable for the association of Elongator with nascent RNA transcript 
      in vivo. In contrast, Elongator-RNA interaction requires the Elp3 protein.
      Together, these data shed light on the structure-function relationship of the
      Elongator complex.

TI  - Subunit communications crucial for the functional integrity of the yeast RNA
      polymerase II elongator (gamma-toxin target (TOT)) complex.
PG  - 956-61
AB  - In response to the Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin, the gamma-toxin target (TOT)
      function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (pol II) Elongator
      complex prevents sensitive strains from cell cycle progression. Studying
      Elongator subunit communications, Tot1p (Elp1p), the yeast homologue of human
      IKK-associated protein, was found to be essentially involved in maintaining the
      structural integrity of Elongator. Thus, the ability of Tot2p (Elp2p) to interact
      with the HAT subunit Tot3p (Elp3p) of Elongator and with subunit Tot5p (Elp5p) is
      dependent on Tot1p (Elp1p). Also, the association of core-Elongator
      (Tot1-3p/Elp1-3p) with HAP (Elp4-6p/Tot5-7p), the second three-subunit subcomplex
      of Elongator, was found to be sensitive to loss of TOT1 (ELP1) gene function.
      Structural integrity of the HAP complex itself requires the ELP4/TOT7, ELP5/TOT5,
      and ELP6/TOT6 genes, and elp6Delta/tot6Delta as well as elp4Delta/tot7Delta cells
      can no longer promote interaction between Tot5p (Elp5p) and Tot2p (Elp2p). The
      association between Elongator and Tot4p (Kti12p), a factor that may modulate the 
      TOT activity of Elongator, requires Tot1-3p (Elp1-3p) and Tot5p (Elp5p),
      indicating that this contact requires a preassembled holo-Elongator complex.
      Tot4p also binds pol II hyperphosphorylated at its C-terminal domain Ser(5)
      raising the possibility that Tot4p bridges the contact between Elongator and pol 
      II.

TI  - Frequent chromosome aberrations revealed by molecular cytogenetic studies in
      patients with aniridia.
PG  - 1138-49
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with aniridia, referred for cytogenetic analysis
      predominantly to assess Wilms tumor risk, were studied by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH), through use of a panel of cosmids encompassing the
      aniridia-associated PAX6 gene, the Wilms tumor predisposition gene WT1, and
      flanking markers, in distal chromosome 11p13. Thirty patients were found to be
      chromosomally abnormal. Cytogenetically visible interstitial deletions involving 
      11p13 were found in 13 patients, 11 of which included WT1. A further 13 patients 
      had cryptic deletions detectable only by FISH, 3 of which included WT1. Six of
      these, with deletions <500 kb, share a similar proximal breakpoint within a
      cosmid containing the last 10 exons of PAX6 and part of the neighboring gene,
      ELP4. Two of these six patients were mosaic for the deletion. The remaining four 
      had chromosomal rearrangements: an unbalanced translocation, t(11;13), with a
      deletion including the WAGR (Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities,
      and mental retardation) region, and three balanced rearrangements with what
      appear to be position effect breakpoints 3' of PAX6: (a) a t(7;11) with the 11p13
      breakpoint approximately 30 kb downstream of PAX6, (b) a dir ins(12;11) with a
      breakpoint >50 kb from PAX6, and (c) an inv(11)(p13q13) with a breakpoint >75 kb 
      downstream of PAX6. The proportion and spectrum of chromosome anomalies in
      familial (4/14, or 28.5%) and sporadic (26/63, or 41%) cases are not
      significantly different. An unexpectedly high frequency of chromosomal
      rearrangements is associated with both sporadic and familial aniridia in this
      cohort.

TI  - Molecular analysis of KTI12/TOT4, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene required for
      Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin action.
PG  - 783-91
AB  - TOT, the putative Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin target complex from Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, is encoded by TOT1-7, six loci of which are isoallelic to RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII) Elongator genes (ELP1-6). Unlike TOT1-3 (ELP1-3) and
      TOT5-7 (ELP5, ELP6 and ELP4 respectively), which display zymocin resistance when 
      deleted, TOT4 (KTI12) also renders cells refractory to zymocin when maintained in
      multicopy or overexpressed from the GAL10 promoter. Elevated TOT4 copy number
      results in an intermediate tot phenotype, which includes mild sensitivities
      towards caffeine, Calcofluor white and elevated growth temperature, suggesting
      that TOT4 influences TOT/Elongator function. Tot4p interacts with Elongator, as
      shown by co-immunoprecipitation, and cell fractionation studies demonstrate
      partial co-migration with RNAPII and Elongator. As Elongator subunit interaction 
      is not affected by either deletion of TOT4 or multicopy TOT4, Tot4p may not be a 
      structural Elongator subunit but, rather, may regulate TOT/Elongator in a fashion
      that requires transient physical contact with TOT/Elongator. Consistent with a
      regulatory role, the presence of a potential P-loop motif conserved between yeast
      and human TOT4 homologues suggests capability of ATP or GTP binding and P-loop
      deletion renders Tot4p biologically inactive.

TI  - Elongator is a histone H3 and H4 acetyltransferase important for normal histone
      acetylation levels in vivo.
PG  - 3517-22
AB  - The elongating, hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is associated with 
      the Elongator complex, which has the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Elp3 as a
      subunit. Here we show that, in contrast to the isolated Elp3 subunit, the
      activity of intact Elongator complex is directed specifically toward the
      amino-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4, and that Elongator can acetylate both 
      core histones and nucleosomal substrates. The predominant acetylation sites are
      lysine-14 of histone H3 and lysine-8 of histone H4. The three smallest Elongator 
      subunits--Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6--are required for HAT activity, and Elongator
      binds to both naked and nucleosomal DNA. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, 
      we show that the levels of multiply acetylated histone H3 and H4 in chromatin are
      decreased in vivo in yeast cells lacking ELP3.

TI  - Characterization of a novel gene adjacent to PAX6, revealing synteny conservation
      with functional significance.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - The human eye anomaly aniridia is normally caused by intragenic mutations of
      PAX6. Several cases of aniridia are, however, associated with chromosomal
      rearrangements that leave the PAX6 gene intact. We have identified and
      characterized a novel gene, PAXNEB (C11orf19), downstream (telomeric) of PAX6.
      Sequence analysis, including interspecies comparisons, show this gene to consist 
      of 10 exons, with an unusually large final intron spanning 134 kb in human and 18
      kb in Fugu. This intron is disrupted by each chromosomal rearrangement. The 2-kb 
      PAXNEB transcript, encoding a 424-amino acid protein, is expressed in all cell
      lines tested. The homologous mouse cDNA is broadly expressed in mouse embryos.
      PAXNEB is highly conserved from mammals to fish, with some regions of the protein
      showing conservation to invertebrates, yeast, and plants. The possible role of
      PAXNEB in aniridia was assessed. Using a transgenic mouse model, we show that the
      aniridia phenotype of the chromosomal rearrangement cases is not due to the
      heterozygous loss of PAXNEB function.

TI  - Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin mode of action is linked to RNA polymerase II
      function via Elongator.
PG  - 1095-105
AB  - The putative Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin target complex, TOT, from Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae comprises five Tot proteins, four of which are RNA polymerase II (RNAP
      II) Elongator subunits. Recently, two more Elongator subunit genes, ELP6 (TOT6)
      and ELP4 (TOT7), have been identified. Deletions of both TOT6 and TOT7 result in 
      the complex tot phenotype, including resistance to zymocin, thermosensitivity,
      slow growth and hypersensitivity towards drugs, thus reinforcing the notion that 
      TOT/Elongator may be crucial in signalling zymocicity. Mutagenesis of ELP3/TOT3, 
      the Elongator histone acetyltransferase (HAT) gene, revealed that zymocin
      sensitivity could be uncoupled from Elongator wild-type function, indicating that
      TOT interacts genetically with zymocin. To test the possibility that zymocin
      functions by affecting RNAP II activity in a TOT/Elongator-dependent manner,
      global poly(A)+ mRNA levels were found to decline drastically on zymocin
      treatment. Moreover, cells overexpressing Fcp1p, the RNAP II carboxy-terminal
      domain phosphatase, acquired partial zymocin resistance, whereas cells
      underproducing RNAP II became zymocin hypersensitive. This suggests that zymocin 
      may convert TOT/Elongator into a cellular poison toxic for RNAP II function and
      eventually leading to the observed G1 cell cycle arrest.

TI  - Characterization of a six-subunit holo-elongator complex required for the
      regulated expression of a group of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 8203-12
AB  - The Elongator complex associated with elongating RNA polymerase II in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae was originally reported to have three subunits, Elp1,
      Elp2, and Elp3. Using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure, we have
      purified a six-subunit yeast Holo-Elongator complex containing three additional
      polypeptides, which we have named Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. TAP tapping and
      subsequent purification of any one of the six subunits result in the isolation of
      all six components. Purification of Elongator in higher salt concentrations
      served to demonstrate that the complex could be separated into two subcomplexes: 
      one consisted of Elp1, -2, and -3, and the other consisted of Elp4, -5, and -6.
      Deletions of the individual genes encoding the new Elongator subunits showed that
      only the ELP5 gene is essential for growth. Disruption of the two nonessential
      new Elongator-encoding genes, ELP4 and ELP6, caused the same phenotypes observed 
      with knockouts of the original Elongator-encoding genes. Results of microarray
      analyses demonstrated that the gene expression profiles of strains containing
      deletions of genes encoding subunits of either Elongator subcomplex, in which we 
      detected significantly altered mRNA expression levels for 96 genes, are very
      similar, implying that all the Elongator subunits likely function together to
      regulate a group of S. cerevisiae genes in vivo.

TI  - RNA polymerase II elongator holoenzyme is composed of two discrete subcomplexes.
PG  - 32743-9
AB  - Elongator is a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates with the
      elongating form of RNA polymerase II. We purified Elongator to virtual
      homogeneity via a rapid three-step procedure based largely on affinity
      chromatography. The purified factor, holo-Elongator, is a labile six-subunit
      factor composed of two discrete subcomplexes: one comprised of the previously
      identified Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3 proteins and another comprised of three novel
      polypeptides, termed Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. Disruption of the yeast genes encoding
      the new Elongator proteins confers phenotypes indistinguishable from those
      previously described for the other elp mutants, and concomitant disruption of
      genes encoding proteins in either subcomplex does not confer new phenotypes.
      Taken together, our results indicate that holo-Elongator is a functional entity
      in vitro as well as in vivo. Metazoan homologues of Elp1 and Elp3 have previously
      been reported. We cloned the human homologue of yeast ELP4 and show that this
      gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues.
